# Persistent Agent Framework

A framework for creating persistent AI agents with hierarchical goals and dynamic task management.

## Overview

This framework provides a foundation for building AI agents that can:
- Maintain persistent state and memory
- Manage hierarchical goals
- Dynamically adjust their operation based on task urgency
- Prevent goal drift and inaction bias

## Architecture

The framework consists of several key components:

1. Goal Management
   - Immutable top-level objectives
   - Strategic mid-level goals
   - Tactical execution goals

2. Memory Systems
   - Nodal memory network
   - Context window management
   - Performance history tracking

3. Execution Engine
   - Dynamic clock rate adjustment
   - Task prioritization
   - Resource management

4. Action Verification
   - State verification
   - Goal alignment checking
   - Performance monitoring

## Getting Started

Documentation and setup instructions coming soon.

## Development Status

This project is in early development. The initial focus is on:
1. Core architecture implementation
2. Basic goal management
3. Memory system design
4. Action verification framework
